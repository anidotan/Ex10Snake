__todo:__
~~1. orange frame doesn't kill the snake - it isn't shown correctly~~
~~V 2. make sure the first frame is correct - 11:30 did it, see if there is still need of the locations in use list in the initilize board~~
2. add a finish when there is no room for apples
~~V 4. when snake dies from explosion show the orange frame (orange covers black) - works need to seperate the times when snakes goes out of board - did it but it seems abit slow~~
